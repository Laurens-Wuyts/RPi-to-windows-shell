  - Running on the windows side.
  - First time run by clicking on it. And view IP adrres.
  - Later you can run it using command prompt "pythonw server.py". Now the script will run in background
  

client.py + index.php
  - On RPi in the /var/www/ folder
  - Browse to the website of your pi and try it out!


<b>! For these files to work you'll need some libraries !</b>
The most libraries are included in python but Pygoogle is not so be shure you download it first.
